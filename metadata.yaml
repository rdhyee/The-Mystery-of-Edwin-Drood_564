description: When young Edwin Drood mysteriously disappears from the quiet cathedral
  town of Cloisterham, foul play seems certain. The prime suspect is John Jasper,
  Edwin's uncle, who frequents the dark opium underworld and conceals a secret passion
  beneath his church choir respectability. Paul Scofield captures the haunting, occasionally
  humorous atmosphere and the many colorful characters in this unusual crime novel.
  Dickens' entertaining story is even more of a mystery than he intended, for he died
  before the work was completed.
